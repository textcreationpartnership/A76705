      * Qu. What, concerning its own uſefulneſs and excollencie?

      * Qu. What doth the Scripture teſtifie concerning its own ſufficiencie?

      * Qu. What paſſage of the Scripture intimates, not onely that the Saints, in the perfect ſtate of the world to come, ſhall ſee God face to face, but alſo comprehend, or fully know him?

      * Qu. Are there not, according to the perpetual tenour of the Scripture, affections, or paſſions in God, as anger, fury, zeal, wrath, love, hatred, mercy, grace, jealouſie, repentance, grief, joy, fear?

      * Qu. Doth not God know all our thoughts, words and actions?

      * Qu. As for our free actions, which are neither paſt, nor preſent, but may afterwards either be or not be, what are the chief paſſages of the Scripture, from whence it is wont to be gathered, that God knoweth not ſuch actions, till they come to paſs? yea, that there are ſuch actions?

      * Qu. How muſt we worſhip God?

      * Qu. How muſt one love him?

      * Qu. Could we love him with all the heart, if he were three? or is his oneneſs the cauſe hinted by Moſes why we ſhould love him thus? How ſound the words according to the See Ainſworth's Tranſlation truth of the Hebrew text?

      * Qu. What if a man ſay he loveth God, and in the mean time hateth his brother?

      * Qu. How was the woman induced to eat of the forbidden fruit? and how, the man?

      * Qu. What effect followed upon their eating?

      * Qu. Did the ſin of our firſt parents in eating of the forbidden fruit bring both upon them and their poſterity the guilt of hell-fire, deface the image of God in them, darken their underſtanding, enſlave their will, deprive them of power to do good, and cauſe mortality?
 If not, what are the true penalties that God denounced againſt them for the ſaid offence?

      * Qu. What ſaith the apoſtle Peter alſo concerning the time and maner of his being made Lord?

      * Qu. Did not Jeſus approve himſelf to be God by his miracles? and did he not thoſe miracles by a Divine nature of his own, and becauſe he was God himſelf? What
 is the determination of the Apoſtle Peter in this behalf?

      * Qu. Could not Chriſt do all things of himſelf? and was it not an eternal Son of God that took fleſh upon him, and to whom the humane nature of Chriſt was perſonally united, that wrought all his works? Anſwer me to theſe things in the words of the Son himſelf.

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Qu. Doth the Scripture avouch Chriſt to be the Son of God becauſe he was eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or for other reaſons agreeing to him onely as a man? Rehearſe the paſſages to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What ſaith the Son himſelf concerning the prerogative of God the Father above him?

      * Qu. What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. Howbeit is not Chriſt dignified, as with the title of Lord, ſo alſo with that of God, in the Scripture?

      * Qu. Was he ſo the God of Thomas, as that he himſelf in the mean time did not acknowledge another to be his God?

      * Qu. Have you any paſſage of the Scripture, where Chriſt, at the ſame time that he hath the appellation of God given to him, is ſaid to have a God?

      * Qu. HOw many Holy Spirits of Chriſtians are there?

      * Qu. Wherein conſiſts the prerogative of the Holy Spirit above other ſpirits?

      * Qu. Whence is the Holy Ghoſt ſent?

      * Qu. By whom?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt affirm that he alſo ſends him? how ſpeaketh he?

      * Qu. Had Jeſus Chriſt always the power to ſend the Holy Ghoſt, or did he obtain it at a certain time?

      * Qu. What were the general benefits accruing to Chriſtians by the Holy Ghoſt?

      * Qu. What are the ſpecial benefits accruing to the apoſtles by the holy Ghoſt? what ſaith Chriſt to them hereof?

      * Qu. Should the holy Ghoſt lead them into all truth, as ſpeaking of himſelf, and imparting of his own fulneſs? What ſaith Chriſt concerning him?

      * Qu. Do men receive the holy Ghoſt while they are of the world, and in their natural condition, to the end that they may become the children of God, may receive the word, may believe, may repent, may obey Chriſt? or, after they
 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Is Chriſt our Saviour originally and of himſelf, or becauſe he was given, exalted, and raiſed up by another to be a Saviour?

      * Q. How do the Saints expect to be ſaved by Chriſt?

      * Q. IS not Chriſt called the Mediator between God and men?

      * Q. Is not Chriſt alſo called the Mediator of the New Covenant? or of a better Covenant?

      * Q. IS not Chriſt dignified as with the title of Mediator, ſo alſo with that of Prophet?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. WHo ſhall have remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt? What ſaith the Apoſtle Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. For what cauſe, and to what ends was Chriſt Jeſus exalted to his kingdom?

      * Qu. How ought men to honour the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus?

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Ought men to honour the Son as they honour the Father, becauſe he hath the ſame eſſence with the Father, or becauſe he hath the ſame judiciary power? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt Jeſus a Prieſt?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt take this honour to himſelf?

      * Qu. What maner of high-prieſt is Chriſt?

      * Qu. Was not Chriſt a prieſt whilſt he was on earth, namely when he died on he croſs?

      * Qu. What benefit happeneth by Chriſts prieſthood?

      * Qu. Unto whom is Chriſt, as a Prieſt, become the authour of eternal ſalvation?

      * Qu. How can Chriſt ſave them by his prieſthood?

      * Qu. Is not the ſacrifice of Chriſt to be reiterated, as that of the Levitical Prieſts? if not, what is the reaſon thereof?

      * Qu. How did Chriſt enter into the holy place to offer himſelf?

      * Qu. Why would God have Chriſt come to his prieſtly office by ſufferings?

      * Q. What is the true and genuine uſe you would have us make of this doctrine?

      * Qu. WAs it the will and purpoſe of God that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer the death of the croſs? What ſaith the apoſtle Peter to the Jews concerning this?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. What ſaith David?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. HOw many ſorts of juſtification or righteouſneſs are there?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Qu. What is the duty of children and parents, according to Paul?

      * Qu. What is the duty of ſervants and maſters, according to the doctrine of the two aforeſaid Apoſtles?

      * Qu. WHat would the apoſtle Paul have men in general do? How ſpeaketh he?

      * Qu. IS not Prayer a Chriſtian duty?

      * Q. How ought men to pray?

      * Q. What if a man doubt or waver as he prayeth?

      * Q. What if we pray in anger, and do not forgive, if we have ought againſt any?

      * Qu. What then is the confidence that we have to God-ward in praying?

      * Q. If a man ſee his brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, what is his duty in relation to prayer?

      * Qu. What if he ſin a ſin which is unto death?

      * Qu. How are the perſons that have ſinned unpardonably, and ſo unto death, deſcribed in the Scripture?

      * Qu. How ſtands the Lord affected to them that call upon him?

      * Qu. Is he nigh unto all them that call upon him in whatſoever maner?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt himſelf preſcribe a form of prayer to his diſciples, ſo that there remaineth no doubt touching the lawfulneſs of uſing a form?

      * Qu. How muſt we make our addreſſes to the Father that we may receive whatſoever we pray for? what ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples?

      * Qu. Was it the cuſtome, during the time that Chriſt converſed on the earth, (much leſs before he came into the world) to pray unto God in the name of Chriſt, or through Chriſt? or did it begin to be uſed after the reſurrection and exaltation of Chriſt? what ſaith Chriſt himſelf concerning this?

      * Qu. Have ye any example of praying to God through Chriſt after his reſurrection, and exaltation?

      * Qu. WHat is Chriſt in relation to the Church, and the Church in relation to him?

      * Qu. What doth Chriſt elſewhere ſay of himſelf, that may give aſſurance to the Church that this promiſe ſhall be made good?

      * Qu. WHen Chriſt was aſcended up on high after his death and reſurrection, and ſo ceaſed to be perſonally preſent
 with his Church, whom did he ſet apart for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of his body?

      * Qu. What is the advice of the two great Apoſtles Paul and Peter to the elders and governors of the Church?

      * Q. What reward doth the apoſtle Peter tell them they ſhall have at the appearance of Chriſt, if they do as he preſcribeth?

      * Qu. WHat is the judgement of John the Baptiſt, of Chriſt Jeſus, and of the Apoſtle Peter touching the doctrine of Baptiſms? How ſpeak they?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Foraſmuch as ſo great ſtreſs is put by ſome upon water-baptiſm, what baptiſm is it, (even in the judgement of the Apoſtle Peter,) whereby we are ſaved; the ſaid baptiſm of water, whereby the filth of the body is waſhed off: or the baptiſm of the heart, whereby it is cleanſed from an evil conſcience?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Qu. WHat is the judgement of John the Baptiſt, of Chriſt Jeſus, and of the Apoſtle Peter touching the doctrine of Baptiſms? How ſpeak they?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. But divers think the Apoſtles were ſent to baptize as well as to preach. What therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle concerning this alſo?

      * Qu. Foraſmuch as ſo great ſtreſs is put by ſome upon water-baptiſm, what baptiſm is it, (even in the judgement of the Apoſtle Peter,) whereby we are ſaved; the ſaid baptiſm of water, whereby the filth of the body is waſhed off: or the baptiſm of the heart, whereby it is cleanſed from an evil conſcience?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. Could not Chriſt do all things of himſelf? and was it not an eternal Son of God that took fleſh upon him, and to whom the humane nature of Chriſt was perſonally united, that wrought all his works? Anſwer me to theſe things in the words of the Son himſelf.

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Qu. Doth the Scripture avouch Chriſt to be the Son of God becauſe he was eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or for other reaſons agreeing to him onely as a man? Rehearſe the paſſages to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Do men receive the holy Ghoſt while they are of the world, and in their natural condition, to the end that they may become the children of God, may receive the word, may believe, may repent, may obey Chriſt? or, after they
 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Qu. Was it the cuſtome, during the time that Chriſt converſed on the earth, (much leſs before he came into the world) to pray unto God in the name of Chriſt, or through Chriſt? or did it begin to be uſed after the reſurrection and exaltation of Chriſt? what ſaith Chriſt himſelf concerning this?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. But divers think the Apoſtles were ſent to baptize as well as to preach. What therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle concerning this alſo?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Qu. Doth the Scripture avouch Chriſt to be the Son of God becauſe he was eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or for other reaſons agreeing to him onely as a man? Rehearſe the paſſages to this purpoſe.

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Ought men to honour the Son as they honour the Father, becauſe he hath the ſame eſſence with the Father, or becauſe he hath the ſame judiciary power? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. What benefit ſhall accrue to him that ruleth ſo?

      * Q. What is the duty of wives and huſbands, according to the doctrine of the two great apoſtles, Paul and Peter? Rehearſe their words.

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Qu. Doth the Scripture avouch Chriſt to be the Son of God becauſe he was eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or for other reaſons agreeing to him onely as a man? Rehearſe the paſſages to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Do men receive the holy Ghoſt while they are of the world, and in their natural condition, to the end that they may become the children of God, may receive the word, may believe, may repent, may obey Chriſt? or, after they
 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Is not Chriſt alſo called the Mediator of the New Covenant? or of a better Covenant?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. How ought men to honour the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus?

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Ought men to honour the Son as they honour the Father, becauſe he hath the ſame eſſence with the Father, or becauſe he hath the ſame judiciary power? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though what you have cited out of the apoſtle Paul doth intimate the duty of the Magiſtrate, yet have you not ſome paſſage of Scripture that doth expreſly ſet it down?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Why ſhall they that reſiſt, receive damnation?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Qu. Do men receive the holy Ghoſt while they are of the world, and in their natural condition, to the end that they may become the children of God, may receive the word, may believe, may repent, may obey Chriſt? or, after they
 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Is not Chriſt alſo called the Mediator of the New Covenant? or of a better Covenant?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c? How ſpeaketh the Scripture hereupon?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Ought men to honour the Son as they honour the Father, becauſe he hath the ſame eſſence with the Father, or becauſe he hath the ſame judiciary power? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. What ſaith David?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Q. Why muſt every ſoul be ſubject to them?

      * Q. What doth he that reſiſteth the power; and what ſhall they receive to themſelves?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

 are become the children of God, have received the word, do believe, do repent, do obey Chriſt?

      * Qu. IS not Chriſt in Scripture called a Saviour?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. May men call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt? and have you examples of ſuch as have prayed to him?

      * Q. What ſay the diſciples in general concerning the ſame?

      * Q. Did Chriſt die to reconcile and bring God to us, or on the contrary, to reconcile and bring us to God?

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. What ſaith David?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How is the righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, deſcribed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11. Num. 12. 6, 7, 8. can you cite any paſſage of the Scripture, which intimateth that Chriſt did ſee God, before the diſcharge of his Prophetick Office?

      * Qu. From whence doth it appear that Chriſt, like to Moſes, heard from God the things that he ſpake?

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence was it, in the judgement of Chriſt himſelf, that his diſciples had believed that he came out
 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. Doth not Iohn the Baptiſt affirm that Chriſt ſurpaſſed all others, becauſe he came down from heaven above? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Is Chriſt Jeſus already inveſted in his kingdom, and did he after his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of God, exerciſe dominion and ſoveraignty over men and angels? Rehearſe ſome clear paſſages of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. What danger is there in not honouring the Son?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Is it the will of God that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped of angels and men?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. Are the Angels of the ſame opinion with the Saints, when they alſo aſcribe glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they alſo explain themſelves.

      * Qu. For whom did Chriſt die?

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. What ſaith Jeremiah?

      * Qu. Ought Chriſt, as to ſuffer, ſo alſo to riſe from the dead the third day?

      * Qu. Was there ſo great power and conſequence in Chriſts reſurrection? How ſpeaketh Paul?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. What is the prayer of the Apoſtle Paul to this purpoſe? How ſpeaketh be to the Epheſians?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. Have you not examples of the choiceſt Saints, who obeyed God in hope of the reward, both before, under, and after the Law?

      * Qu. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Chriſtians may attain to perfection of vertue and godlineſs? and that it is the intention of God, and Chriſt, and his miniſters, to bring them unto this pitch? Rehearſe the texts to this effect.

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection before the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any example of perfection under the Law?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Q.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any example of keeping the commandments under the law? what ſaith David of himſelf?

      * Qu. Have you any example under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

Is not he accepted of God?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

 believing Romans were baptized, into what doth he ſay they were baptized, and to what end?

      * Qu. Foraſmuch as ſo great ſtreſs is put by ſome upon water-baptiſm, what baptiſm is it, (even in the judgement of the Apoſtle Peter,) whereby we are ſaved; the ſaid baptiſm of water, whereby the filth of the body is waſhed off: or the baptiſm of the heart, whereby it is cleanſed from an evil conſcience?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

 with his Church, whom did he ſet apart for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of his body?

      * Qu. WHat is the judgement of John the Baptiſt, of Chriſt Jeſus, and of the Apoſtle Peter touching the doctrine of Baptiſms? How ſpeak they?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. But divers think the Apoſtles were ſent to baptize as well as to preach. What therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle concerning this alſo?

      * Qu. Howbeit when Paul himſelf, and the
 believing Romans were baptized, into what doth he ſay they were baptized, and to what end?

      * Qu. Foraſmuch as ſo great ſtreſs is put by ſome upon water-baptiſm, what baptiſm is it, (even in the judgement of the Apoſtle Peter,) whereby we are ſaved; the ſaid baptiſm of water, whereby the filth of the body is waſhed off: or the baptiſm of the heart, whereby it is cleanſed from an evil conſcience?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh Peter?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?

      * Qu. Was not this written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

      * Qu. On what terms? if we apprehend and apply Chriſts righteouſneſs to our ſelves?

      * Qu. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Is it not ſufficient for us if we believe as he did? what ſaith Chriſt?

      * Qu. What ſaith Peter?

      * Qu. Doth not God juſtifie men, becauſe of the full price that Chriſt paid to him in their ſtead, ſo that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient to ſatisfie for a thouſand Worlds? If not, how are they ſaved?

      * Qu. Did not Chriſt merit eternal life, and purchaſe the kingdom of heaven for us?

      * Qu. ARe the commandments poſſible to be kept?

      * Qu. But though it be poſſible to keep the commandments, yet is it not enough if we deſire
 and endeavour to keep them, although we actually keep them not? And doth not God here accept the will for the deed?

      * Qu. Which? Mat. 19. 18.

      * Qu. Though it be not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſary to keep the commandments, yet is it lawful ſo to do, that we may have a right to eternal life, and the heavenly inheritance? may we ſeek for honor, end glory, and immortality
 by well doing? is it the tenor of the Goſpel that we ſhould live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally, ought we to ſuffer for the kingdom of God, and not (as ſume are pleaſed to mince the matter) from the kingdom of God? Cite the teſtimonies of the Scripture to this purpoſe.

      * Qu. Have ye any Scripture that ſaith we muſt believe that God is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, and that if we come not to him with ſuch a faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?

      * Qu. Have you any examples under the Goſpel?

      * Qu. If works be ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as you have before ſhewn from the Scripture, how cometh it to paſs that Paul ſaith, We are juſtified by faith without works? Meant he to exclude all good works whatſoever, or onely thoſe of the Law? How doth he explain himſelf?

      * Qu. Can you make it appear from elſewhere, that Paul intended to exclude from juſtification onely the perfect works of the Law, which leave no place for either grace
 or faith, and not ſuch works as include both? and that by a juſtifying faith he meant a working faith, and ſuch a one as is accompanied with righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. What anſwer then would you give to a man, who wreſting the words of Paul in certain places of his Epiſtles to the Romans and the Galatians, ſhould bear you in hand, that all good works whatſoever are excluded from juſtification and ſalvation, and that it is enough onely to believe?

      * Qu. What is the advice of Paul to Titus concerning the buſineſs of faith, and works, and the Law?

      * Qu. You ſhewed even now out of Paul, that the faith of him that will be ſaved, muſt be accompanied with juſtice or righteouſneſs; I would therefore know of you who is a juſt or righteous man? is it not ſuch a one as apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſts righteouſneſs to himſelf, or, at moſt, deſireth to do righteouſly? Is not he accepted of God?

      * Qu. May not righteous men depart from their righteouſneſs, and believers from their faith, and ſo periſh? And is it not falſe, that once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt?

      * Qu. WHat is the duty of all them that are under authority?

      * Qu. How ſhall a man behave himſelf that he need not fear the power; and whence cometh it ſo to paſs?

      * Q. Is not the fear of wrath or puniſhment the onely motive to ſubjection?

      * Qu. Muſt we not alſo pay to the higher powers tribute and cuſtom?

      * Q. Why ſhould we pay tribute to them?

      * Qu. Though the paſſages which you have alledged plainly intimate that the baptiſm of the Spirit was the baptiſm of Chriſt, as that of water was Johns baptiſm, yet did not the Apoſtles of Chriſt baptize with water? what ſaith Paul of this alſo?

      * Qu. Howbeit when Paul himſelf, and the
 believing Romans were baptized, into what doth he ſay they were baptized, and to what end?

      * Qu. Foraſmuch as ſo great ſtreſs is put by ſome upon water-baptiſm, what baptiſm is it, (even in the judgement of the Apoſtle Peter,) whereby we are ſaved; the ſaid baptiſm of water, whereby the filth of the body is waſhed off: or the baptiſm of the heart, whereby it is cleanſed from an evil conſcience?

      * Qu. Shall not the wicked and unbelieving live for ever, (though in torments,) as well as the godly and the faithful? or is eternal life peculiar to the faithful?

      * Qu. Though this paſſage which you have cited ſeem clearly to prove that eternal life agreeth unto no other men, but the faithful: yet ſince the contrary opinion is generally held amongſt Chriſtians, I would fain know farther of you, whether you have any other places that directly affirm that the wicked dye, and that a ſecond death; are deſtroyed, and puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; are corrupted, burnt-up, devoured, ſlain, paſs away, and periſh?

      * Qu. What reaſon doth the Son render, why the Father did not forſake him, and caſt him out of favour? was it not becauſe he was of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that it was impoſſible for the Father to forſake him; or ceaſe to love him?

      * Q. Foraſmuch as Chriſt was to be a Prophet like unto Moſes, and Moſes had this priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himſelf known to him in a viſion, nor ſpake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to a friend, and ſhewed to him the ſimilitude of the Lord, Exod. 33. 11.

      * Qu. Can you further cite any paſſages to prove that Chriſt as a man aſcended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven, before he ſhewed himſelf to the world, and diſcharged his Prophetick Office; ſo that the talking of Moſes with God in the perſon of an angel bearing the name of God, was but a ſhadow of Chriſts talking with God?

 from God? what ſaith he?

      * Qu. You have already ſhewed that Chriſt was like unto Moſes in ſeeing God, and hearing from him the things which he ſpake. But Moſes exceeded all other Prophets likewiſe in that he onely was a law-giver. Was Chriſt therefore like unto Moſes in giving a law alſo? and is there any mention of his law?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt then partly perfect, partly correct the law of Moſes? What is the determination of Christ himſelf concerning this matter?

      * Qu. You have made it plainly to appear that the law of faith, or the new covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Mediator, is better then the law of works, or the old covenant, whereof Moſes was the Mediator, in reſpect of precepts: is it alſo better in reſpect of promiſes?

      * Qu. Were thoſe better promiſes of God touching eternal life and immortality hidden in the dark, and not brought to light under the law?

      * Qu. Though the promiſes of the Goſpel be better then thoſe of the law, yet are they not (as well as thoſe of the law) propoſed under conditions of faith and perſeverance therein, of holineſs and obedience, of repentance, of ſuffering for Chriſt and his truth, &c?

      * Qu. Doth not Chriſt himſelf forgive ſins? What ſaith the Apoſtle Paul?

      * Qu. When Chriſt forgave ſins on the earth, did he forgive them as being God, or as being a man impowered by God? Likewiſe when he now forgiveth ſins in heaven, doth he forgive them as God, or as one exalted by God to that end? Cite the Scriptures pertinent hereunto.

      * Qu. WAs not Chriſt Jeſus to be a King? what ſaith the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary concerning this?

      * Qu. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, becauſe he had in him the divinenature perſonally united to the humane, or becauſe he was the Son of man? What is the deciſion of the Son himſelf concerning this point alſo?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his death and reſurrection? what examples thereof have you?

      * Qu. Did men worſhip Chriſt after his reſurrection and aſcenſion? And what example thereof have you?

      * Qu. When men aſcribe glory and dominion to Chriſt Jeſus in the Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it becauſe they conceive him to be very God of very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of the Divine eſſence, or becauſe he gave himſelf to death? Let me hear how they explain themſelves.

      * Q. What was the procuring cauſe of Chriſts death?

      * Qu. What are the ends of Chriſts ſuffering and death, intimated by the Scripture?

      * Qu. THoſe Scriptures which you have already alleadged, when I enquired for whom Chriſt died, intimate the univerſality of Gods love to men: yet ſoraſmuch as this is a point of the greateſt importance, without the knowledge and belief whereof, we cannot have any true and ſolid ground of coming unto God, (becauſe if he from all eternity intended good onely to a few, and thoſe few are not ſet down in the Scriptures, (which were written that we through comfort of them might have hope, Rom. 15. 4.) no man can certainly, yea probably infer that he is in the number of thoſe few, the contrary being, ten thouſand to one, more likely) what other clear taſſages of Scripture have you, which ſhew, that God, in ſending Chriſt, and propoſing the Goſpel, aimed not at the ſalvation of a certain elect number, but of men in general?

      * Qu. Theſe texts which you have now cited, are all taken out of the New Teſtament; is there not a like manifeſtation of the univerſality of Gods love in the Old? How ſpeaketh the prophet Ezekiel?

      * Qu. Did Chriſt riſe by his own power, yea did he raiſe himſelf at all? or was he raiſed by the power of another, and did another raiſe him? What is the perpetual tenour of the Scripture to this purpoſe?

      * Qu. Were the Apoſtles and the Holy Spirit himſelf ſent to bear witneſs that Chriſt raiſed himſelf, or that God raiſed him? How ſpeaketh the Scripture?

      * Qu. Of what conſequence is it to believe that Chriſt was thus raiſed?

      * Qu. How ſpeaketh the righteouſneſs
 which is of Faith?

      * Qu. But what ſaith it? Rom. 10. 8.

      * Qu. In the juſtification of a believer, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him? or is his own faith counted for righteouſneſs?

      * Qu. Was Abraham the father of the faithful, juſtified in this maner?
